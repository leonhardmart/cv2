        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro" >I am a digital business student at Padjadjaran University. I believe that hard work will yield the best results.

I am highly self-motivated, responsible for a job and have a hardworking spirit in challenging situations. I am also fluent in Indonesian and passive in English.

Within the organization I served as a student center staff at the digital business student association and I quite often participated in the committee. this is what makes me gain a lot of knowledge not only from academics but also from non-academics, but I am not satisfied with all the knowledge that I get and I will continue to look for challenges and new experiences that I can make new knowledge.

I always remember one motivation that I will always hold on to, namely learning from mistakes and being grateful for success.</p>

          <h3>Language</h3>
          <p> As a person who was born in Indonesia, I have been taught to speak Indonesian for a long time so it is very fluent. while for English I took a course because I realized that English would be the number one language in the world, for now I can only listen to English.</p>
